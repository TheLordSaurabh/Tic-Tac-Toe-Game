#Tic Tac Toe Game 

Web App of the Game (React JS) : https://thelordsaurabh.github.io/tic-tac-toe-game/  


The Classical Tic-Tac-Toe Game Web Application made using HTML, CSS and React Js. In this 2-Player Game, there is initially a 9x9 empty grid and there are two players (Player-X and Player-O) who play their chance one-by-one. In each turn one of the player tries to fill one of the empty boxes in the grid using it's Player Symbol ('X' for Player-X and 'O' for Player-O) and after this, in the next turn, the other player plays its turn by filling its symbol in another empty box. The first player to fill three boxes either in a row or column or diagonal wins the game. The game consits of multiple rounds and for multiple rounds the scoreboard displays the score of the individual player. The Game App also has the features to Reset any round of the game at any moment (while maintaining the scores of the player in a particular tournament) and also a to Restart the whole game leading to a completely new tournament. I hope you will enjoy the game! Thank you! ;)
